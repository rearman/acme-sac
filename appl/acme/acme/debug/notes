There will be a mainwin that list the current running progs.  Right
clicking on a prognum will grab the prog and open a new debug window
on it.  The debug window shows the stack and responds to commands to
step and control the prog.  The step will append to the window the
current file position which can be right clicked to open the source
window on that line.


/prog/-Tasks   | Get Debug "cmd args"
Get refreshes the task list with current status of each task

/prod/pid/-Debug | Step Cont Stop Unstop Expand

we need a way of expanding the stack by rightclicking on a symbol in the stack output.


so mainwin replaces wm/task
and the Pidwin replace wm/deb and wm/debdata
and normal acme replace wm/src

we also need a view of breakpoints.

we will keep a debsrc module.
this will be useful with the stack.

use plumbing when stepping through code to have acme keep up with the code point.

Instead of plumbing every step we need to write directly to the source window ctrl file to select the line or expression. And setbpt
and the currently selected line we need to find the source file in acme window and get the selection there.

so one window is going to talk to another window through the acme file system.
