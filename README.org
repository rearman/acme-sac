* Acme-Sac

This repository is a copy of the Acme-Sac code from [[https://code.google.com/archive/p/acme-sac/][google code]], with my changes to make it livable in Windows 10.

* Notable changes: 
** [[usr/inferno/lib/plumbing][/usr/inferno/lib/plumbing]]
Some additions for my specific use-cases, added filetypes mostly, also added some extra characters to the regexps for folders.
** [[usr/inferno/lib/functions][/usr/inferno/lib/functions]]
Moved the prompt function to [[usr/inferno/lib/profile]], added git function to call os with the undocumented =-T= option (better path parsing).  
** [[dis/hp][/dis/hp:18]]
Added =s|‚ê£| |g;= to be able to send files to windows with a space in the filename.
** [[lib/sh/profile][/lib/sh/profile:15]]
Changed drive letters to match my setup.
** [[usr/inferno/dis][/usr/inferno/dis]]
Some shell scripts in here that work together with org-style links and tags to re-create somewhat of a roam/logseq environment.  Find more about the format [[https://github.com/rearman/note-format][here]].  In short, things in double-brackets go through =tr= to create nice filenames and get a =.note= extension.
