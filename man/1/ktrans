.TH KTRANS 1
.SH NAME
ktrans \- language transliterator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ktrans
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ktrans
program is usually installed as a layer over
.B /dev/keyboard
using
.IR pipefile (1).
It transliterates typed letter sequences into characters in
languages that do not use the Latin character set.
.PP
Currently only English to Tamil transliteration is
supported, based on the mapping defined by Anjal, a phonetic
keyboard for Tamil.  The transliterated characters are
encoded in TUNE.  Typing
.B ctl-K
toggles between Tamil and the default English mode.
.SH EXAMPLE
To install
.I ktrans
between
.B /dev/keyboard
and
.IR acme (1):
.EX
.IP
pipefile -r ktrans /dev/keyboard
acme -f /fonts/madhavi/unicode.8.font

windows after inputting a partial character sequence,
unexpected characters may be printed.
